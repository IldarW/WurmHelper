A client helper mod

**Attention!!**

I personally used this mod only on servers where client modes were not prohibited. 
Obey the server rules and **_don't use this mod if autoclickers, macros or another automation tools were banned on the server_**

**Usage:**

type "info" in game console to see the list of available commands

**What mod can do:**

  1) Automatic crafting
  2) Automatic mining and smelting
  3) Automatic forestry
  4) Automatic foraging and botanizing
  5) Some tools for automatic inventory items management
  6) Automatic item improving
  7) Another various things, making the gameplay easier
